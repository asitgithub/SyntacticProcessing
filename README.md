# Syntactic Processing - NLP


**Title:** Disease and Treatment Identification in Healthcare Text Data Using NLP

**Introduction:**

This project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model capable of identifying diseases and their corresponding treatments within healthcare data. The model leverages syntactic processing techniques to extract this critical information.

**Problem Description:**

Imagine a platform like "BeHealthy" that caters to both patients and healthcare professionals. Doctors can manage patient interactions, appointments, and e-prescriptions, while patients can book appointments, access medical records, and order medications online. Such platforms generate massive amounts of textual data related to healthcare.

This data might contain implicit mentions of diseases and their treatments within sentences. For instance, the sentence "The doctor recommended chemotherapy for the patient's cancer diagnosis" implies cancer as the disease and chemotherapy as the treatment.

Here's the challenge: the data doesn't explicitly link diseases with their treatments. Our task is to build a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that extracts both entities (diseases and treatments) from the text data.

**Solution Approach:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Transform the raw data into sentence-level formats for both training and testing datasets.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Define features that aid the model in identifying disease and treatment entities within sentences.

3. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Apply the defined features to each sentence in the training and testing datasets to generate feature vectors.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Define the target variable (i.e., disease and treatment labels).
   - Train a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model using the features and target labels.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.

6. **Post-processing:**
   - Create a dictionary mapping identified diseases as keys to their corresponding treatments as values.

**Expected Outcome:**

This project will result in a functional NLP model trained on healthcare text data. The model should be able to accurately extract disease-treatment pairs, providing valuable insights for various healthcare applications.
